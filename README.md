# Blockscape

A Minecraft clone built with C++, GLFW and OpenGL.

Makefile commands:
- ```make build``` -> Build without running
- ```make run``` -> Run without building
- ```make``` -> Build and run

If you don't have make or don't know how to use it, you can find a pre-compiled executable inside **build** folder.
